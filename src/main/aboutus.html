     <h3>About Dhindo</h3>
     <p title="About dhindo">Dhindo is a traditional Nepali food that holds cultural significance in the country. 
        It's a type of meal made from buckwheat or millet flour and water. The preparation involves
         mixing the flour with water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and continuously stirring it over heat until it becomes a thick,
          dough-like consistency.

        Dhindo is typically served with various side dishes such as lentils, vegetables, pickles, 
        or meat. It's often consumed as a staple food in many parts of Nepal, especially in rural areas.
         Due to its simplicity and nutritional value, dhindo remains popular among Nepali communities 
         both domestically and abroad. It's not just a meal but also a symbol of <em>Nepali culture and 
         tradition.</em>
