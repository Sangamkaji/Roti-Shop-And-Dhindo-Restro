<P>Maida is a finely milled wheat flour that is used to make a variety of foods such as Indian bread
     like naan, paratha, and puri, as well as snacks like samosas, pakoras, and various sweets like
      halwa and cakes.

    So, "maidako roti" might refer to a type of flatbread or bread made using maida flour instead of
     whole wheat flour. It would likely have a different texture and taste compared to roti made from
      whole wheat flour. However, it's important to note that in traditional Nepali cuisine, roti is 
      typically made from whole wheat flour, so the term "maidako roti" might not be a common or 
      traditional dish in Nepali cooking.
