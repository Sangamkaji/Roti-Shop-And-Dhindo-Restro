<p>Kodo, also known as "kodo millet," is an essential ingredient in Nepali cuisine, particularly in the 
    hilly and mountainous regions where it's grown abundantly. Here's a look at how kodo is used in Nepali
     food:

    Roti (KODO ko Roti): Kodo millet flour is commonly used to make roti, a type of flatbread. KODO ko
     Roti, made from kodo millet flour, is a staple in many Nepali households, especially in rural areas. 
     It's often served with various accompaniments such as lentils, vegetables, pickles, or meats.
    
    Dhido: Dhido is a traditional Nepali dish similar to polenta, made by continuously stirring a mixture
     of kodo millet flour and water over heat until it thickens into a dense porridge-like consistency.
      It's typically served with side dishes like lentils, vegetables, or pickles.
    
    Alcoholic Beverages: Kodo millet is also used in the preparation of traditional alcoholic beverages 
    in Nepal. One such beverage is "Tongba," a millet-based alcoholic drink popular in the mountainous 
    regions. Tongba is made by fermenting kodo millet grains and then serving the fermented liquid in a
     wooden vessel called a "tongba," which is consumed through a bamboo straw.
    
    Snacks and Sweets: Kodo millet is occasionally used in snacks and sweets in Nepali cuisine. It might
     be incorporated into traditional snacks or sweets to add texture and nutritional value.
    
    Nutritional Value: Kodo millet is highly nutritious, rich in protein, dietary fiber, vitamins, and 
    minerals. Its nutritional profile makes it a valuable addition to the Nepali diet, providing essential
     nutrients and energy, especially in regions where other grains may be less available.
    
    Overall, kodo millet is an integral part of Nepali food culture, offering versatility, nutritional
     benefits, and a connection to traditional agricultural practices. Its use in various dishes 
     highlights its importance in Nepali cuisine and its role in providing sustenance to communities
      across the country.
