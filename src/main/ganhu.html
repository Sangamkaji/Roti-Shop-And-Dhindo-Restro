<p>"Gahu ko Roti" translates to "wheat flatbread" in English. It's a traditional Nepali dish made from 
    wheat flour and is a staple food in many households across the country. Here's more about it:

    Ingredients: Gahu ko roti is typically made from whole wheat flour (gahu ko atta), water, and 
    sometimes salt. The dough is kneaded with water until it reaches the right consistency for rolling.
    
    Preparation: The dough is divided into small portions, which are then rolled out into thin, round 
    shapes using a rolling pin. The rolled-out dough is then cooked on a hot griddle or skillet until
     both sides are golden brown and cooked through.
    
    Serving: Gahu ko roti is often served hot, straight from the skillet. It can be enjoyed with various
     accompaniments such as lentils, vegetables, pickles, or meats. It's a versatile dish that can be
      paired with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian curries and side dishes.
    

    Nutrition: Gahu ko roti is a nutritious food item, as it's made from whole wheat flour, which retains 
    most of the nutrients present in wheat. It's a good source of carbohydrates, fiber, protein, and
     essential vitamins and minerals.
    
    Cultural Significance: Roti, including gahu ko roti, holds cultural significance in Nepali cuisine 
    and is a common feature in daily meals as well as during festivals, celebrations, and religious
     ceremonies. It's considered a symbol of hospitality and is often served to guests with various 
     accompaniments.
    
    Overall, gahu ko roti is a simple yet essential dish in Nepali cuisine, providing nourishment,
     taste, and cultural value to those who enjoy it.
