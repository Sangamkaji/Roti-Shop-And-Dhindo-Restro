<p>Phapar, also known as Phapar ko Roti, is a traditional flatbread from the mountainous regions of Nepal,
    particularly popular among the Gurung and Magar communities. It's distinct from regular roti due to
     its unique preparation method and ingredients.

   Phapar is made from buckwheat flour (known as "kodo ko atta" in Nepali) mixed with water and sometimes
    salt. The dough is kneaded and then shaped into round, thick patties. Unlike regular roti, which is 
    rolled out thinly, Phapar is kept thick and hearty.
   
   Traditionally, Phapar is cooked on a hot, flat stone or griddle called a "tawa" without using any oil
    or ghee. It's cooked until it develops a crisp exterior while remaining soft and chewy inside. The
     result is a rustic, dense bread with a unique nutty flavor characteristic of buckwheat.
   
   Phapar is often served with various accompaniments such as lentils, vegetables, pickles, or meats.
    It's a staple food in many households in the hilly and mountainous regions of Nepal, providing 
    essential nutrition and sustenance in challenging environments where wheat cultivation may be limited.
   
   Due to its distinct taste and cultural significance, Phapar remains an integral part of the culinary 
   heritage of Nepal's mountain communities. It's not only a food but also a symbol of tradition and 
   identity for those who prepare and enjoy it.</p>
